        <br>
    <h4>Brief Portions</h4>
    <p style='font-size:16px'> This course deals with oscillations, wave theory, interference, electromagnetic waves, diffraction and quantum mechanics, primarily consisting of wave mechanics. The tentative midsem portion covers usually till EM waves or  diffraction, as the case may be.</p>   
    <br> 
    <h4>Books To Be Referred</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Physics of Vibrations and Waves, by HJ Pain [dc/bo]</li>
         <li>Lecture Notes and Problem bank for Physics, Saraswat and Sastry [bo]</li>
        <li>Solutions to the above book, are Irodov Solutions [dc]</li>
         <li>Optics by Hecht [lb]</li>
         <li>Oscillations and Waves, by Prof. Somnath Bharadwaj [bo]</li>
        
        </ol> 
        <br>
    <h4>Points To Note:</h4>   
    <ol class="paragraph">
        <li><p style='font-size:16px'>Primary requisite to score decently in this subject is to read the 2nd book in the above list thoroughly, and corelate the problems with its respective solutions [third book in the above list]. The problem types encountered here are somewhat similar to the ones in the midsem/endsem exams, and even if not, they give a good deal of confidence to the candidate.</p></li>
        <li><p style='font-size:16px'>Pace must be maintained with the class. Also, utilise your tutorial classes to effectively bring out your doubts to be clarified. If you do not get the problem, try to read it over and over again, so that it strikes you at some point.</p></li>
        </ol> 
        <h4>Marks Distribution</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>30 - > Midsems</li>
        <li>50 - > Endsems</li>    
         <li>20 - > Tutorial</li>        
        </ul>
        <p style='font-size:16px'>The 20 marks in the tutorial component may be awarded either for a class test conducted in the tutorial, or even partially due to attendance within the tutorial class. Hence, physics tutorial is important to attend.</p>
        <h4>Question Paper Pattern</h4>
        <ul class="paragraph3">
        <li><p style='font-size:16px'>Midsemester: You may expect around 10 questions of 3 marks each, or similar denomination. It is usually noted that choice is offered for questions.</p></li>

<li><p>Endsemester: The type of questions is similar to that of midsemester. Time Management usually is not a problem in Physics exams.</p>

    <h4>Points To Note:</h4>   
    <ol class="paragraph">
        <li><p style='font-size:16px'>For all those, who have already learnt C [or C++/Java, for that matter] in their previous years : Revise your fundamentals, and this course should be easy for you. Question papers need to be solved and their difficulty needs to be assessed. Step onto competitive programming, or try something which takes you further steps ahead.</p></li>
        <li><p style='font-size:16px'>For those who are new to C : Start reading from a book [refrain from reading directly from slides/notes] and gain an overall understanding first. Out of the subjects in this semester, spend atleast 30 mins – 1 hr everyday reading/re-reading PDS. This will take you on par with your other ‘learned’ peers. Solving questions from the back of textbooks will improve your understanding of the language specifics. Consider all of the above non textual references to the best of use.</p></li>
        </ol> 
        <h4>Marks Distribution</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>30 -> Midsem (60 marks scaled to 30)</li>
        <li>50 -> Endsem (100 marks scaled to 50)</li>    
         <li>20 -> 2 class tests (each of 40 marks scaled to 10)</li>        
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Question Paper Pattern</h4>
        <ul class="paragraph3">
        <li><p style='font-size:16px'>Midsem, Endsem : Small snippets of code will be required from your side. You will be assessed on your ability to read the code, and understand the algorithm which the question paper setter is trying to follow, and fill in the blanks with necessary code-blocks. 1-2 questions may ask you to write an entire function. However, mostly the questions will revolve around asking the outputs, which may test your overall program-implementation skills. Should be easy if you are good with your fundamentals. Be careful and beware of a tricky paper waiting for you.</p></li>

        <h4>Question Paper Pattern</h4>
        <ul class="paragraph3">
        <li><p style='font-size:16px'>The papers consist of just 4-5 questions, both in the midsem and in the endsem. Students are advised to read the question once, and work out in rough the algorithm/method to solve the system. Once sure, it is usually not a cumbersome solution. The solution should basically click. Part marking is provided for drawing the free body diagrams, which is even otherwise mandatory to draw.</p></li>

    <ol class="paragraph">
        <li><p style='font-size:16px'>This course easily becomes one of the most tough courses you will encounter in your first year. But according to me, it is a course where you can learn a lot about visualization. It is a must for any engineering discipline to understand, as virtual design is an imperative aspect for every engineer’s project.</p></li>
        <li><p style='font-size:16px'>Be prepared for an assignment-every-class as every class’s course work amounts to your grade. Read the requisite part from the book before the class, and use the book as a reference for drawing.</p></li>

    <h4>Points To Note:</h4>   
    <ol class="paragraph">
        <li><p style='font-size:16px'>The pre-midsem portion is pretty much simple, and relies on simple Kirchoff Laws. Thus, summarizing, the concepts in this subject are easy to grasp, but the calculations are cumbersome.</p></li>
        <li><p style='font-size:16px'>Regular practice of problems from the appropriate chapter from Parker Smith is advised for fluency in calculations, as in the end, nothing but speed is necessary. Also, try to come up with faster and cut-to-the-chase solutions to problems.</p></li>
        <li><p style='font-size:16px'>Sufficient time is usually available before the exams, hence it can be well prepared for.</p></li>
        <li><p style='font-size:16px'>Tutorials occur in the lab slot on alternative weeks, and are very useful as the professor/TAs might introduce some new tricks/ways of solving some circuits.</p></li>
        <li><p style='font-size:16px'>This is one of the most important subjects from the viewpoint of an EE, and I may daresay, more than 50% of the fundamentals are covered in this extensive course. Thus, from an EE point of view, develop a holistic understanding of the subject by reading more text books related to the field.</p></li>

            <p>Be ready for a lengthy paper, consisting of 5-6 questions of 10-15 marks each. Also, aim for completing a question completely, to gain marks for that question, as incomplete answers are awarded close to no marks. The final answer is very important. This concept is similar even for the endsems.</p>

    <h4>Points To Note:</h4>   
    <ol class="paragraph">
        <li><p style='font-size:16px'>This is one of the most fundamental stepping stones for your EE knowledge and career. No matter what field you go into, this is a subject you will stumble forth and back, be interrogated on Viva-Voce again and again. And it is such a subject, which you have to try to internalise. So, read the first reference book I’ve mentioned, which is given in lucid language with perfectly capturing examples.</p></li>
        <li><p style='font-size:16px'>There is no easy way out in this subject. You have to do problems from the end of the chapter and you can refer the solutions. The questions are tricky, and I found it really useful to solve them. Moreover, they are repeated in the tutorial class, so you can ace them once you muster your fundamentals.</p></li>
        <li><p style='font-size:16px'>Question paper pattern is similar to ET. Adopt a ‘correct-problem-solving’ approach than a hasty approach.</p></li>
        <li><p style='font-size:16px'>Grading is skewed in this subject, so be prepared for the same.</p></li>
        <li><p style='font-size:16px'>This subject is one of the basics and pre-requisites for important research areas like Image and Signal Processing, so pay attention to this course.</p></li>
        </ol> 
        <h4>Marks Distribution</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>30 - > Midsems (60 scaled to 30)</li>
        <li>50 - > Endsems (100 scaled to 50)</li>    
         <li>20 - > 2 class tests (each 40 scaled to 10)</li>        
        </ul>
        <p style='font-size:16px'>Usually, papers are lengthy/difficult, so out of a total of 240, a score above 150-160 is said to give you an A or an EX, depending upon the specific stats. So, do prepare yourself to get a decent score.</p>

    <h4>Points To Note:</h4>   
    <ol class="paragraph">
        <li><p style='font-size:16px'>This is a simplistic course, which can be understood properly by just reading the text. The question paper is also straight forward. This course is a fundamental building block to Analog and Digital Electronics [these 2 courses again start off from where you leave in Introduction to Electronics]. So make sure you know your stuff.</p></li>
        <li><p style='font-size:16px'>Several online slides are available [google them]. The lab component is also self explanatory.</p></li>

    <h4>Points To Note:</h4>   
    <ol class="paragraph">
        <li><p style='font-size:16px'>This is a simple math course which can be suitably learnt using the textbook and of course, practice. The course work is light and you may just be expected to submit some assignments as part of your internal assessments. Part of this would’ve already been covered in your Signals and Networks course, and thus is even easier.</p></li>

    <h4>Points To Note:</h4>   
    <ol class="paragraph" >
        <li><p style='font-size:16px'>Class notes are important for this subject as the books contain much more than necessary for this course. It would be a good way to attend classes, know what is there, and read up the same from the text books.</p></li>
        <li><p style='font-size:16px'>The question paper pattern is the same as Physics I. Some portions of Quantum Mechanics in Physics I are repeated here.</p></li>
        <li><p style='font-size:16px'>Out of the other subjects in this sem, it eventually ends up, that we give least time to this course. Ensure that you are at par with the class.</p></li>
